# MusicMetadata - A Godot 4 Plugin

Parses and contains common music file metadata.

This extention allows for common metadata parsed from music files, with the ability to parse (currently only ID3 formatted) metadata from files. The user may also use this as a means to store manually defined metadata about music tracks, as the data contained is not automatically linked to any changes made after the parsing of a file.

Also includes a UI display for this metadata, which can be used as an example, or as is.

This plugin is based off of 'MusicMeta', created by Aineejames and Wilcockj, under the MIT licence.

This plugin itself is also licenced under the MIT licence.
